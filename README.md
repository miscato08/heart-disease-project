# heart-disease-project
This is a project I wrote in a course I took to get better in coding. It was really helpful, because it was one of my first projects and I learned how to create projects from end to end.

We've covered a lot of things like EDA, Data Science and Visualisation, Modelling and more using:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit Learn

### Something about the Project
It is a supervised-learning project and we've used structured Data.
It is really really discriptive and for beginners, because I will tell some things about how to create a conda environment to get started at the beginning

### Heart-Disease Notebook
The main notebook, where we code everything

### Data folder
Our Data, stored into a heart-disease.csv file

### Env folder
This is our Environment. I also have a yml file, where everything is stored. In the Notebook you can see how to set up your Environment using the yml file
